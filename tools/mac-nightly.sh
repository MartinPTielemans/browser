# The Mac's nightly engine (#871): at 03:00, a launchd agent builds main's Release engine and
# publishes it (tools/mac-engine-publish.sh), when main's core or engine differ from the newest
# engine-mac release, so GitHub's hosted Macs check main on it (.github/workflows/check-mac.yml).
# launchd runs a night the Mac slept through when it wakes. Nothing on GitHub starts it: the Mac
# pulls main.
# It builds in the one engine tree, this checkout's engine/.deps/src, from a worktree of main of its
# own in ~/.cache/ilo-mac-nightly, whose engine/.deps is that one. It skips the night when an engine
# build or setup is running in it, when the tree holds a patch main's series never had, such as a
# branch's being tried, or when the tree's Chromium isn't the one main pins, which the integrator
# takes in with engine/setup.sh update. It never runs the browser, so it never touches
# /Applications/ilo.app, a profile or the Keychain; only gh's login, which uploads the release.
# Usage: mac-nightly.sh install|uninstall|status|run. install starts the agent on this checkout,
# uninstall stops it and removes the worktree, status says whether it's on and how the last night
# went, and run is the night itself, which the agent runs. Its log: ~/Library/Logs/ilo-mac-nightly.log.
