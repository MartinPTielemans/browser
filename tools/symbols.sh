# Uploads a release's crash report symbols to the collector app/branding/crash-reports names
# (docs/decisions.md, 9) with sentry-cli: the files and folders given, which sentry-cli searches for
# debug files, and on Windows the engine's PDBs, which its release keeps apart from it
# (engine/fetch.sh symbols). SENTRY_URL, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN, SENTRY_ORG and SENTRY_PROJECT name the
# collector's project: for ilo's, https://de.sentry.io, the EU region, though an organization
# token's own URL wins over SENTRY_URL. Without the token, the owner's to make, or with no
# collector, as in a fork's build, it says so and uploads nothing; with the token but not the rest
# it stops. Given nothing, it checks only that, so a release stops before it builds.
# Usage: tools/symbols.sh [file or folder]...
