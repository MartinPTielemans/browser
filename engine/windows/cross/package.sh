# Beside it, <output>-symbols.zip has the PDB of each of its executables and libraries, for crash
# reports (tools/symbols.sh). With symbol_level=0 they name functions but hold no lines.
# Nothing of Microsoft's toolchain goes in but what FILES.cfg names from the SDK's redistributable
# files (D3DCompiler_47.dll), which Chrome ships too.
