# Prepares Chromium for Linux in <work>/src, the way ungoogled-chromium-portablelinux's x64
# releases are built, at the tag pins.ini names: its source tarball, ungoogled-chromium's patches
# and domain substitution, its GN args and toolchain. Then links the core in as //browser_core and
# applies our series. Prints the tree's path. check-linux.sh and build.sh build from it, and
# .github/workflows/engine-linux.yml keeps one on its runner. Needs about 40 GB, and as much again
# while a new version comes in.
#
# A new tag is prepared whole in <work>/next, then copied over the tree by content (#299), so a
# point release leaves every file it doesn't change as it was and the next build recompiles only
# what changed. With the tag already in the tree, only the series and the GN args are brought up
# to date.
