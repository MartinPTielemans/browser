# A page's popup opens as a tab in the window, under the page. The page's context menu is Chrome's
# without the items the window can't do, shown in ilo's menu at the click: a dismiss leaves the page
# free to show another, and a text field's has its spelling and writing direction items and Select
# All, which selects the field's text for typing to replace. Its Open Link in New Tab opens a tab
# under the page without showing it, after the tabs the page opened before and above the others, and
# closing one shows the nearest other tab the page opened. A link's tab opened behind shows the
# link's address and loads only once it's first shown, and one still waiting at a quit comes back
# after the relaunch, while a window the page makes behind loads at once. Its Print and ⌘P from the
# page show print preview centred over the page, at its top, which takes the keys typed and escape
# closes. Switching or closing a full-screen page's tab ends its full screen and the window's, and
# closing it shows the tab it opened first. A sign-in popup, as Google's, keeps its opener through
# the identity site and back, sends the page what it got and closes itself, which the page sees,
# and the page shows again.

# A page's popup opens as a tab in the window, as links to new tabs do, instead of a window of
# Chrome's own.
