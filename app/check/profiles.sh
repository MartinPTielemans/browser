# The New Space form's Profile row makes a profile, asks for its name, and puts the Space in it, and its Choose a Theme
# row colours the Space. The Space's tabs open in the new profile, without the first profile's
# cookies, from a command bar opened in the first profile's Space too, which follows the Space shown. While it's empty the Space's menu moves it between profiles, and with a tab it keeps its
# own. The first Space keeps its cookie and its favorite, which shows only in the Spaces of its
# profile, and a new Space made from a Space is in that Space's profile. After a relaunch each Space
# is in its profile still. A tab moved to the other profile's Space loads there with that profile's
# cookie, after a warning the first time. Settings › Profiles renames a profile, which the Space
# menu then shows, and makes and deletes one. Each profile there has its own search engine, which
# the command bar searches with in its Spaces, its own archive time, its own download folder, which
# its Space's downloads go in, and Clear… for its browsing data, as ⇧⌘⌫ opens it for the Space
# shown. Little ilo's bar picks the other profile for its page, which is kept for the site.
# Deleting the Space leaves its profile unused, and Delete in the menu deletes it once the
# user confirms.

# The cookie page's title says whether it finds its cookie, p, never a value, since the app logs
# every title, and "c" sets it. The cookie outlives the run, so its value is this run's start and an
# earlier run's doesn't count. It's on localhost, as clear.sh's cookie is on 127.0.0.1. A key
# sent before the page first paints can miss it, so the page draws text and says when it has
# drawn. Its title also shows each click and key it gets, to show where one went.
