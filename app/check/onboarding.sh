# A new profile's first launch plays the onboarding over the window, captured at each step in a
# light and a dark appearance: the intro draws ilo's wordmark and its line and goes on by itself, or
# at any key; the import step lists the made-up Arc in src/import/fixture (a made-up Chrome on
# Linux), never the Mac's own browsers; Esc or Skip goes on from a step, the colour step's Return
# gives the first Space the swatch picked, and the last step leaves the flow for the first Space's
# welcome with the command bar up and a line under it. The default browser's step shows only while
# ilo isn't the default, and is skipped everywhere but a Linux CI VM, where its button makes ilo
# the default for a moment, so the run never changes a desk's. The opt-ins' shows always, with
# the agents' switch, as every build has their server, and the dark pass turns it on in its new
# profile and sees the server start. Help › Welcome to ilo
# plays it again, in the window while it shows no page and in a new window while it shows one. A
# launch that brings Spaces back never starts it. Every other run sets BROWSER_ONBOARDING=skip
# (check.sh); this one sets the appearance instead.
