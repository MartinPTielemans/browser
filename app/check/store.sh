# The Chrome Web Store installs, updates and removes an extension through its own page. Its "Add to
# Chrome" asks with the browser's dialog, listing Chrome's warnings, and return adds the extension
# to the Extensions menu. At the next launch, the extension's update check asks Google's store and
# reads its answer. The page's "Remove from Chrome" asks with Chrome's dialog, and return removes
# it. With no store extension left, the next launch's update check asks no one. It needs the
# network and Google's store, so it runs only when named: ./check.sh store.

# uBlock Origin Lite: well known, open source, it opens no page when added and sends nothing home.
# English, whatever the Mac's language, as the check finds the store's buttons by their text. It
# installs in a profile of the run's own, as the extensions run's .crx does.
