# With the lists uBlock Origin ships and nothing given for the check, a page's script from Google's
# ad network doesn't load, and an ad server's own page doesn't open: uBlock Origin shows its page
# saying it blocked it instead. uBlock Origin fails the script's request, or answers it with a
# stand-in of its own that loads, so the page's ads find nothing missing (its lists' filter for it
# says redirect=googlesyndication_adsbygoogle.js). It needs the network and those servers, so it
# runs only when named: ./check.sh adblock-live.

# The served page's title says whether Google's ad script loaded, was blocked, or was blocked by
# uBlock Origin's stand-in, whose adsbygoogle.push does nothing, where Google's queues an ad.
