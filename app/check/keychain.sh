# The profile survives a change of signing identity, as from Apple Development to Developer ID,
# with no Keychain prompt (platform/mac/updates.mm, tools/requirement.sh). A copy of the prod build
# signed with identity A and its own requirement, as Apple Development's names its certificate,
# takes a login cookie. Signed with A again under the team's requirement, it makes its cookie key's
# item again, granted to that requirement. Signed with identity B, the cookie is still sent.
#
# Only in a check VM, as it uses the real Keychain, the VM's login keychain: never the owner's.
# The prod build first, ./build.sh prod, then ./check.sh keychain, alone.
#
# A and B are throwaway self-signed identities made here, in a keychain of the run's own that's
# deleted after; their OU stands in for the team. Apple's anchor has no stand-in: codesign over ssh
# can't sign with a leaf whose authority isn't trusted (errSecInternalComponent), and trusting one
# needs a user at the screen. The copies have a name of their own for each run, so the cookie key's item is the run's.
# A team's identities share a Keychain partition, teamid:<team>, which identities with no team ID
# don't, so with KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD, the VM user's login password, the run adds each copy's own to
# the item's as a stand-in. Without it, a prompt the partition causes fails the run, and says so.
