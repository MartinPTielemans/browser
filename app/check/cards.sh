# Resting on a sidebar tab's row shows its hover card beside the rows (#430): a picture of a tab
# not shown, taken once the switches that hid it are quiet and never on a switch, its title and
# host, and its buttons. The tab shown has no picture, as its page is beside the card. The next row
# swaps its card in at once, and leaving the rows, scrolling them or a key lets it go. Its buttons
# each make their call on the first click (#818). It comes in and goes out in Dia's motion, which
# card-motion.mp4 records. The card takes the Space's look, dark and light. Over a hidden sidebar
# out, the card counts as the sidebar's (#830). Reports how long the switches take, beside the tabs
# run's.
