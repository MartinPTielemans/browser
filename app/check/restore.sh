# Launched again after ⌘Q, and again after its window's close button, the app brings back the
# Spaces: their names, colours and icons, their tabs with each tab's history, the tab each showed
# and the Space it showed, and the sidebar's width. Only a tab shown loads; the others show their
# titles and favicons. A tab named with a double-click on its row, where escape cancels, keeps its
# name over its page's title, and Rename… in its menu with no name gives the title back. An
# emoji picked in the icon picker that Change Icon… hangs under its favicon takes the favicon's
# place until Remove Icon, and a Japanese conversion in the picker's search isn't a pick. A Space's
# icon, picked in its icon picker, comes back too. A tab closed before the quit stays closed,
# in the archive, from which the Library reopens it at its page. A page's downloads go in the
# check's folder, on the Mac with macOS's quarantine flag, a new one's icon flies
# into the Library button, none of those a relaunch reads does, and ⇧⌘J opens the Library on
# Downloads, which lists them. While one runs, the button keeps
# its name and resting on it shows the running one with the finished one. With one running, ⌘Q
# asks first: Continue Downloading shows the Library's Downloads, and Quit quits, cancelling it.
# After the relaunch, Remove from List and Clear List take them off the list and keep their files.
# A new download's row dragged hands its file to the system's drag, the Library closing until it's
# let go. Resting on the Library button shows the newest finished downloads, each with its picture
# or its type's icon, and the menu of one's row there has Move to Trash, which puts its file in the
# Trash. A SIGTERM, which macOS sends at logout and restart, keeps a tab opened just before it.
# Reports how long putting them back takes.
# With the auto-archive's 12 hours made 8 s, a Today tab no window has shown for that long goes in
# the archive, counting the time across a quit, and the tab shown stays. The first tabs it takes
# bring a note, until View Archive answers it, which opens the Library there, and never again. A
# tab put back unshown has no page until it's first shown, when its page loads scrolled where it
# was. A quit with a page full screen saves its window windowed.
# With Restore windows from last session off, a launch opens one window with no page, the Spaces
# and pinned tabs back and the Today tabs in the archive.

# The Spaces come back after a quit and after the window closes: their names, their tabs with each
# tab's history, the tab each showed and the Space the window showed. Back and Forward on a tab put
# back go through its saved history, and a window that quit full screen comes back so, unless a page
# took it there. Only a tab shown loads, and one that doesn't shows its title and its favicon from
# the profile's history, which keeps none for data: pages, so the first page is served. A tab the
# user closed stays closed.
