# Back and forward go through the tab's history from keys, with the page or the UI focused, from
# the header's buttons, which dim with nowhere to go, and from a swipe over the page. Reload loads
# the page again, and while a page loads, reload is stop, which ⌘., escape and the button do. A
# tab's row shows its page's favicon, and keeps it until the next page has loaded without one. A
# host typed in the command bar goes over https first, then http, and a local one over http.

# Back, forward, reload and stop. stuck.test leads to a server that takes connections and never
# answers, so its page keeps loading until it's stopped, and $plain to the check's own, which has no
# https. The profile remembers a host that fell back to http, so each run names a new one.
