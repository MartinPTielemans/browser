# A page's submitted login brings our offer to save its password, a card 18 in from the page
# card's top right corner, which keeps its place through a resize. Showing another tab closes it,
# and showing the tab again doesn't bring it back, but the key after the host in the URL field
# does. Japanese input composes in its username field, where return commits it without saving;
# return saves the username as left in the field, and the login page fills the saved password in
# after, with a key that opens the Site Controls. Chrome's dropdown under the username field fills
# the login in again once the password is cleared. Blink's eye in the password field shows once a
# password is typed into it, never for the one filled in, and goes with the field's focus. A
# changed password brings the offer to update it, and escape there declines. On another site,
# Never answers, and that site's Site Controls list it in a Passwords row whose menu takes it off
# Never. On the first site, the row names the login, All Passwords… lists it in Settings, whose
# Remove asks first and whose Manage Passwords… opens Chrome's page listing it, and the row's
# Remove asks in the browser window's dialog and removes it, which Settings hears. Then a sign-up
# form's new-password field offers Chrome's strong password, where Choose Your Own leaves the field
# to the user and Use Strong Password fills it and saves it, with no offer. Last, Settings' Offer
# to save passwords, switched off, keeps the next login from bringing the offer, and Save and fill
# addresses switches off and on. Each run has a profile of its own, which no other run or the
# owner's copy reaches.

# The login page, in a new profile, whose passwords start empty, with a DevTools client that sees
# the eye in its password field (check/cdp.py).
