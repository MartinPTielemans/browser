# An MCP client reaches the browser through the bridge beside it once Settings › Agents is on and
# it's connected, as the saved settings say here. The socket is the user's alone, and the bridge
# gets nowhere without the agent's token. Its first call makes its Space, and it may list and read
# only the tabs there: its list leaves out the user's tab, a read of the user's tab is refused, with
# an activity-log entry, and a read of example.com, opened in its Space, gives the page's text. A
# page with fields gives its prose and none of their values: typed, filled in or a password, in its
# text and in its outline, and the agent can't type into the password field. It types into another.
# A page's frames, of its own site and of another, are in its outline, where the agent clicks and
# types, and not into a frame's password field. Its text leaves out a frame an extension puts in
# the page, which isn't the page's. Where it acts in the page shown, its pointer and a
# ring with the element's ref show it. It opens a page, clicks its link, scrolls, takes a screenshot
# and closes a tab, and a bank's site asks first, in a card whose Allow Once opens it. Always Allow
# opens it from then on, until Revoke Permission in the Space's menu takes that back. A login the
# user saved fills in neither as the agent's tab loads it nor from a dropdown, and fills once the
# user takes the tab over, without a reload. Closing the client's end ends its session with the tab,
# and turning Settings › Agents off takes the socket away and drops a client connected.
