# A crash leaves a minidump in the profile's Crashpad folder: --crash-after-start crashes the
# browser once it has started, Crashpad's handler is up and the profile's Preferences say its
# session crashed, the handler writes the report, and no Chromium process outlives the crash, the
# handler included. Nor does one outlive a quit.
# A new profile's first launch offers Send Crash Reports at its onboarding's opt-ins step, as the
# run names a collector, check/collector.py, where a prod build alone names the real one. Left off
# there with Esc, nothing goes to the collector: the launch after a crash offers to send that
# crash's report in a toast, and keeps it. Turned on at a new first launch's step, the report goes
# at once, the minidump and Sentry's field saying to keep no IP address, without cookies and with
# no annotation naming the profile's folder or the home, and is deleted once the collector has it.
# One the collector refuses waits for the next launch, and turning the switch off in Settings ›
# Privacy deletes it, which only the Mac's run clicks so far.
# On Windows it runs on the folder check/git-bash.sh gives chrome.exe, as only the prod build's
# lines up by itself.
