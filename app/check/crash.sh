# A crash leaves a minidump in the profile's Crashpad folder: --crash-after-start crashes the
# browser once it has started, Crashpad's handler is up and the profile's Preferences say its
# session crashed, the handler writes the report, and no Chromium process outlives the crash, the
# handler included. Nor does one outlive a quit.
# Nothing goes to the crash collector, check/collector.py, while Send Crash Reports is off, as it is
# at first: the next launch offers to send that crash's report in a toast, and keeps it. On, the
# next launch sends the report, the minidump and Sentry's field saying to keep no IP address,
# without cookies and with no annotation naming the profile's folder or the home, and deletes it
# once the collector has it. One the collector refuses waits for the next launch, and turning
# the switch off in Settings › Privacy deletes it, which only the Mac's run clicks so far.
# On Windows it runs on the folder check/git-bash.sh gives chrome.exe, as only the prod build's
# lines up by itself.
