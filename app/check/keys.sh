# Clicks move keyboard focus between the page and the UI, and typing goes where the focus is. With
# the page focused, the browser's reserved shortcuts reach the UI and never the page, and the others
# reach the page first, which can keep them. ⌘N, from the page and the UI, opens a window whose UI
# has the keyboard, and ⇧⌘W, from either, closes it, giving back the page it took, live, as ⌘W does
# in a window with no page. ⌘Q asks
# first: Cancel keeps the browser, and Quit, and don't ask again quits and turns the warning off.
# The command bar opens over the page with the keyboard, never showing the last query, gives the
# keyboard back when it closes, a held escape that closes it doesn't repeat into the page, and it
# loads what's typed in it, over https for a host typed without one, or searches DuckDuckGo for
# words. A .new address typed, docs.new, gets its row, which opens it in a new tab. A page it opens
# in a new tab has the keyboard: its autofocused field gets what's typed, and ⌘T opens the bar
# again. While ⌘T's is open, "New Tab" has the selected plate. Keys typed right after ⌘T, ⌘L or ⌘F,
# from the page or the UI, wait for the bar it opens, however late the page answers ⌘L, and land in
# its field, a composition too, and a page that keeps ⌘F gets them after it. Japanese input composes
# and commits in the page and in the command bar, where return and escape go to the input method
# while it composes. The Edit menu's Undo, Redo and Select All reach the focused page. ⌘Y opens the
# history page from the page and the UI. A page whose renderer crashes leaves the browser running,
# and ⌘R loads it again. Settings › Shortcuts lists every command the user can give keys, and
# gives New Tab ⌃⌘T, which stays reserved and reaches
# the UI from both sides, while ⌘T no longer runs it, and its ↺ gives ⌘T back. About ilo shows
# Settings' About tab, with Settings key and with About already showing. The Shortcuts tab lists
# the sidebar's commands, and Focus Sidebar given ⌃⌘K there takes the keyboard from the page, as
# its own F6 does once Restore Defaults gives it back. Go to Space 1 given ⌃⌘1 there shows the
# first Space, and ⌃1 no longer does. Include Favorites in ⌘1–⌘8 turned off there has ⌘1 show the
# first tab that isn't a favorite, until Restore Defaults. A shortcut the page keeps, ⌘F here, runs
# ilo's on a second press at once, and Prefer ilo on it, from a right-click on its keys there, runs
# ilo's first, until Prefer Websites.
# ⌘T as the window comes on screen, before the overlays' windows are made, makes them and opens
# the bar.

# The test page puts what reached it in its title, which the app logs. Chromium drops input
# to a page that hasn't drawn yet, so the page says when it has.
