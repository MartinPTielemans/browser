# selected tab named by its page's title in the Today tab group, after New Tab. ⌘T's bar has the
# keyboard in a text field called "Search or Enter URL", lists its suggestions with the first
# selected, and ↓ selects the next; ⇧F10 opens its field's menu on the first item. A tab's menu is
# the app's window in front and a menu of menu items and separators, whose Move to opens a submenu.
# It reads the tree from outside, as an assistive app does: on the Mac through tools/ax-tree.sh,
# which needs this terminal to have the Accessibility permission, on Linux as Orca does, over
# AT-SPI through tools/atspi-tree.sh, which needs dbus-daemon and at-spi2-core, and on Windows as
# Narrator does, over UI Automation through tools/uia-tree.sh, which needs Python's comtypes.
# Without them the run says it skipped, and it never asks for the permission.

# Each role as the run's reader writes it, and how the tab shown says it's selected.
