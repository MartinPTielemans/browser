# its page in a tab of no Space, and the pinned tab stays on its page. Esc closes it and its page.
# ⌘↩ keeps it as the top Today tab, shown, without loading it again. A click on the dim closes it,
# and the page behind doesn't get the click, and so does Settings taking the keyboard. ⌘W with its
# page focused closes it, and not the tab behind. ⌘Z reopens a closed one over its tab at its page,
# and so does ⇧⌘T while no tab has closed since. A favorite's link opens it too. A call's link, such
# as Google Meet's, opens as a tab instead. With the Settings switch off, the link goes in the
# pinned tab. Back on, a link rule to another Space sends the link there as a tab instead. Reports
# how long the first preview took to draw its first frame.
