# The menu bar's Extensions menu lists the turned-on extensions of the shown Space's profile, by
# name, over Pin to URL Field and Manage Extensions…. Choosing one runs its action on the tab shown,
# as a click on its toolbar button does in Chrome: one without a popup hears the click, and a
# pop-up window it opens is a window of its own, not a tab, and one with a popup opens it with the
# keyboard, which escape closes, giving the browser window the keyboard back. Pin to URL Field's
# items pin an extension's action at the URL field's end, in the order pinned, showing its badge
# for the tab shown as it changes. A click on a pinned action runs
# it, its popup hanging from it, and its right-click menu unpins it, opens its options or its
# details on Chrome's extensions page, or removes it once the user confirms. The actions that don't
# fit are behind an overflow button in the last place, whose menu runs them. Manage Extensions…
# opens Chrome's extensions page. The Site Controls list every turned-on extension, unpinned ones
# too, and a click on one's tile runs it, its popup hanging from the tile. A right-click on a tile
# gives its menu: Move to Top pins it first, Unpin puts it back by name, and Remove asks first. An
# extension's keyboard commands run with the page focused and with the UI, but a key it suggests
# doesn't take one of the browser's. An extension's side panel opens from its action as a card right of the page, drags
# from its left edge to resize, closes from its header's ✕ and ⋯ menu, and goes as its tab does. An
# extension reaches a desktop app's native messaging host that only another Chromium browser's
# folder has. Chrome asks whether to add an extension with the browser's dialog, which lists what
# Chrome warns it can do: escape cancels, and return adds it. Add Extension… opens the Web Store in
# a new tab.

# Four unpacked extensions of the check's own, loaded as a developer loads one. A click on the
# first gives the tab it's on a badge, then opens its page, which opens a pop-up window of its own
# as MetaMask's confirmations do and closes it once it has seen it's a window with one tab, saying
# so in its title, and its command ⇧⌘Y opens another. The
# second's popup gives it a badge on every tab, and ⌥⇧P opens it. The third has a popup and
# options, and suggests ⌘J, Jump to Selection's key, which Chrome gives away, for a command. The
# check removes it, and the next loads it again, as Chrome leaves an unpacked extension's folder.
# A click on the fourth's action opens its side panel, and its command ⌥⇧K turns that off for
# every tab but the one it's on, with a panel of its own, and opens it.

Their keyboard commands and their actions' keys run from the page and the UI, but one they suggest that's the browser's stays the browser's. An extension's side panel opens from its action as a card right of the page with its page loaded, its page takes the keyboard, its edge drags it narrower, its header's ✕ and ⋯ menu close it, and a tab's own panel goes on a switch to a tab without one and comes back with it at the width given.
