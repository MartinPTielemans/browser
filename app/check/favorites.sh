# A Today tab's menu is Arc's, whose Copy Link is Copy Link as Markdown with ⌥ held, and its row
# dragged onto the Space's name takes the tab out of Today into a tile above the Space's rows, its
# press having shown it. Resting on the tile shows its hover card, which other apps don't take for
# the window in front, and the footer's Library button
# and the header's sidebar button name themselves with their shortcuts' keys on chips, and Clear
# says what it does. A click on the tile shows it, and ⌘1–⌘9 count favorites first. Past its top, the list shows an
# edge under the tile, and showing a tab under its bottom scrolls to the tab's row. Scrolled out of
# the list, the shown tab's row has a marker at the edge it's past, which scrolls back to it. Away
# from its URL, a double-click on the tile goes back there. ⌘W unloads it and keeps the tile,
# showing the top Today tab. The tile's menu hangs the icon picker under the tile, whose pick is the
# tile's icon until Remove Icon, and duplicates it to the top of Today. Launched again, the app
# brings the favorite back, shown, with the icon it was given before the quit, and Remove from
# Favorites in its menu puts it at the top of Today. A row dragged onto the tiles turns into a tile, and a tile dragged into the list
# into a row. Today rows dragged onto the tiles become favorites where they're dropped, a tile
# dragged across the other goes before it, one dragged into the list goes there, and escape puts a
# dragged tile back. Tiles taller than 40 % of the window scroll with the list. ⌘, from the page and
# the UI opens Settings, where switches turn the warning before quitting and the haptics off and the
# menus of two pop-up buttons set how long Today tabs wait for the archive and who shares the
# favorites (Each Space, kept across the quit and its favorite with it, then Each Profile's Spaces
# again), and all of them stay after the quit, when ⌘Q quits without asking. ⌘W and the window's close button hide it, and More
# Settings… opens Chromium's settings in a tab. A Space keeps more than the 12 favorites it shows
# at most from a list saved before there was a most, and with 12 a row dragged over the tiles stays
# a row and a pinned tab's menu dims Add to Favorites.
