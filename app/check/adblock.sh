# The browser blocks ads and trackers from a new profile's first page, with nothing to install:
# uBlock Origin, in the framework, loads into every profile, listed last in the Extensions menu. A
# filter given for the check, through the same managed settings the browser gives it its own,
# blocks the served page's ad script and hides its ad, and it stays in the menu all along, as it
# doesn't reload itself as it first starts. The run reports how long that first launch let requests
# through. It pins as any extension, and its action's menu has no Remove. Its own lists take fbclid
# out of an address. The Site Controls' Block ads and trackers turns that off for the site,
# reloading the page, which then shows the ad, and on again. Off for the site, Settings lists it,
# and its Turn On turns it on there again. Settings' Block ads and trackers turns it off in every
# profile, which takes it out of the Extensions menu and the Site Controls, and on again. A private
# window blocks too. The app ships the version ublock.ini pins, trusting no site, YouTube neither,
# and launched again on the same profile, it blocks there too: its first page, which loaded before
# uBlock Origin was ready, is reloaded once by it, with no reload from the user.

# The served ad page: its title says whether its script ran and whether its ad shows. uBlock Origin
# hides the ad from a stylesheet of its own, which the page can't hear arrive, so it looks again
# every 100 ms.
