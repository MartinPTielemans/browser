# ⌘N opens another window on the same Spaces, showing the key window's Space with no page, whose
# card shows its one line, and a click on the card with ⌘T's bar open only closes the bar. Settings
# opened from it and closed by its button gives it the keyboard back. The new window never shows
# another window's page: a Space it switches to and back shows the first tab no window shows.
# The Spaces menu acts on the window in front. A click on a row whose page another window shows
# moves the page there live, with no second load, and the window it left keeps its rows and draws a
# picture of the page in its card, which a click on takes the page back from, live. A window that
# switches away from the page gives it back to the one with its picture, live, and keeps the
# keyboard. ⇧⌘W closes a window and gives its tabs to the one that was in front before it, live,
# which shows its page again; in the last window it quits. ⇧↩ in the command bar opens its page in
# a new window, as ⌘N makes one, and a Switch to Tab row for that window's page brings the window
# forward rather than taking the page. With the first window in full screen, other apps take the
# second for the window in front once the user is in it. From macOS 14, a page in Safari's engine,
# which the Site Controls turn on for a page that asks for Widevine, moves to another window the
# same way, and the window it left draws WebKit's picture of it, which the core gives from a task of
# its own (#364: an answer inside the call that asked aborted the browser). A heavy page and a light
# one move between two windows every way a page moves, and the run says how long each stage of a
# move takes.

# The page counts in its title from its first frame, so a page that reloaded would count from 1
# again. "o" in it opens a tab under it, as a link to a new tab does. Its beforeunload handler,
# which never asks, has Chrome run the pages' handlers as the last window closes, which once
# archived the page's tab and left the window open (#870).
