# Links from other apps, as `open` sends them on the Mac, the way a link clicked in Mail does, and
# off it as a second launch with the link does, which `xdg-open` makes on Linux. With the app
# running, one opens as a new tab in the Space the window in front shows, and loads there. With an
# agent's Space shown, it goes in the user's Space the window showed before, which comes back; with
# a private window in front, in the regular window, which comes to the front. Settings › Links
# makes rules: a link whose URL holds a rule's text, or is it exactly, opens in the rule's Space,
# the first rule that matches winning, a drag reorders them, everything else goes to the Space
# picked, and − takes a rule away; the rules are kept for the launches after. Settings › General
# says the browser isn't the default, as a dev build never is: on the Mac it declares no links
# (build.sh), and making it the default asks in a system dialog the driver can't answer; on Linux
# the desktop's defaults name no dev build. A link that launches the browser opens over the Spaces
# it brings back, before the UI comes out from under the launch picture. On the Mac ⌘Q keeps the
# sidebar's picture, which both the launch without a link and the one with it show; Linux has no
# launch picture (host_show_launch_window). Reports the launch times from the process's start,
# without a link and with one.
