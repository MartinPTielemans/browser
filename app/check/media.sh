# A tab in a call says so on its row, as Chrome's tab strip does: the camera while its page uses the
# camera, the microphone alone, or the screen while it shares a screen, a window or a tab, and the
# tab it shares shows the screen too. While it shares a tab, another tab's menu has Share This Tab
# Instead, which moves the share there. The marks go once the call ends. A call floats in Picture in
# Picture while its tab is hidden, and comes back with it, unless its Site Controls block that, or
# Settings turns it off for the sites they don't allow; its window moves by its top bar and sizes
# from its corner. A tab playing music out of sight has a player at the sidebar's foot, whose
# buttons pause it and float it in Picture in Picture, whose click shows the tab, and whose × puts
# it away. View › Cast… and the page menu's Cast… open the tab's Cast card, and × closes it. A
# video's page menu floats it in Picture in Picture, the Mini Player, which a scroll or a drag
# moves, ⌘ or Ctrl with a scroll sizes, and a double-click puts back in its tab, shown. Chromium's
# fake camera and microphone stand in for real ones, and the share takes the tab titled Shared
# without its picker; the question for the camera is answered with Allow, as the user would, since
# the fake question Chromium can put in its place never tells the browser what's captured.

serve
# "c" calls with the camera and microphone, "s" shares the tab titled Shared, "e" ends both, "o"
# opens that tab, the same page with ?Shared, whose title is what follows the ?, "p" one titled
# Other, and "m" plays ten seconds of silence over and over, as music titled Quiet with a next
# track: long enough for Chrome to give it controls, and no sound. Asked to float in Picture in
# Picture through its media session, it opens a floating window, which closes as its tab shows.
