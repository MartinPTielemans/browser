# The pictures of ilo for its Microsoft Store listing and the README (#454), from the README shot's
# Space and tabs: a Space "ilo" in the default colour, ilobrowser.com, Wikipedia's Web browser and
# ilo's GitHub repository pinned, and Wikipedia's Chromium and ilobrowser.com/ilo in Today, on
# public pages with a new profile and no accounts. The window fills a 1920 by 1080 screen. It
# captures shots-1-page.png (ilobrowser.com/ilo), shots-2-command-bar.png (the bar's suggestions
# for "wiki"), shots-3-pinned.png (the pinned Wikipedia page) and shots-4-settings.png (Settings
# over the window). It needs the network, so it runs only when named, and checks nothing beyond
# getting there: it says the size of each picture.
