# The page view keeps its margins and GPUI's view fills the window through a resize and full screen,
# and the window's buttons stay in the header row. A page that goes full screen takes the window
# with it, and escape or the page leaving brings both back, the page resized once each way, straight
# to its new size, and its leaving reported once, timed from the page's request to the window's and
# the UI's steps, going in and out. The window leaving full screen by its green button takes the page
# out with it and brings back the sidebar and the card, and the page's full screen takes the window
# again after. A full-screen window's display going away keeps the window and the page together,
# both full screen or both out, and escape and the page's full screen work after; going away while
# the page takes the window full screen leaves both windowed. The footer's menu
# flips up at the screen's bottom in full screen.
# The command bar opens in full screen and keeps the keyboard when a page commits under it, then
# gives the keyboard to the new page, and scrolling a long page doesn't stutter. Dragging the
# window's background moves the window, and the buttons, URL field and rows keep their presses. A
# double-click there zooms it, and one in the
# sidebar below the rows opens a new tab. ⌘S, with the page or the UI focused, and the sidebar
# button hide the sidebar and the window's buttons, and the card takes its place, through a resize;
# ⌘S brings them back, and the core hears the page moves for each motion and is still after it. The
# pointer kept at the window's edge brings the hidden sidebar out, and one passing it doesn't. A tab
# opened with the sidebar hidden says so in a toast, and a click on it brings the sidebar back. The
# sidebar's edge drags its width between 164 and 500, stopping at them, and dragged on past half the
# narrowest it hides the sidebar, keeping its width; a double-click on it puts the width back. A
# page that hasn't drawn yet shows the card's colour, not white. In a check VM, the sidebar over grey
# backdrops is Dia's composite, dark and then light, with the Mac's appearance, and View ›
# Appearance turns the light window dark and back.
