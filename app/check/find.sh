# ⌘F opens the find bar over the page with the keyboard, and what's typed right after it lands
# there. Typing finds in the page, with "n/m", once Japanese input has committed, and return,
# shift-return, ⌘G and ⇧⌘G and the bar's arrows go through the matches, from the bar and from the
# page. A text the page doesn't have shows NOT FOUND. A click
# on the page leaves the bar open, and the bar keeps its place through a resize and full screen.
# Each tab has its own find, which a new tab starts from the text found last; escape and the bar's
# close button close it, and so does another page. ⌘J from the page and Edit › Find › Jump to
# Selection scroll the page back to the match a find left selected. ⌘0 and ⌘- from the page and the
# View menu's Zoom In zoom the page, and the zoom HUD shows the percent under the find bar for a
# moment, and goes at once when another tab shows. ⌥⌘I from the page docks DevTools in the card,
# filling it, with the page on its left, through a resize, and F12 closes them and gives the page
# the keyboard. View › Developer's JavaScript Console opens them, where ⌘A, ⌘C and ⌘V are the
# console's, a tab without them shows its page across the card, and View Source opens the page's
# source in a tab under it. Help › Troubleshooting's Open Task Manager opens Chrome's, with the
# keyboard, and ⌘W there closes it, not the tab. Its Record a Trace records until the toast's Stop,
# which shows while it records, and the command bar offers to stop it meanwhile; Stop saves
# Chromium's trace where the save panel picks.
# Undocked, after a relaunch, ⌥⌘J opens DevTools in a window of Chrome's, where ⌘C copies
# the console's text to the run's own pasteboard and ⌘V pastes it, and ⌥⌘I from the page brings
# them to the front.
