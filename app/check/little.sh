# Little ilo, Arc's Little Arc. ⌥⌘N opens a Little ilo window for the Space the window shows, under
# its bar, and ⌘L there opens the command bar, whose URL loads in it. ⌘O moves its page, live, to
# that Space in the main window and closes it. ⌥⌘-click on a link opens the link in one, not
# beside the page as ⌥-click does, and ⌘W closes that window, its page with it. An escape the page
# doesn't use closes one. A tab its page opens goes behind, to the top of its Space's Today, and
# outlives it. Closing one archives its tab, and ⇧⌘T reopens it in a new one. The first opens 900 × 640, and each after at the size the last one closed at. On the
# Mac one opens over a full-screen window, and the Dock's menu opens one after its New Window, and
# hides and shows them all.
