# New Space in the Spaces menu makes a Space and shows it, empty and without a page, with a form
# that takes the keyboard from the page. Japanese input composes in its field, return while
# composing only commits, and return names the Space and sends the form away; ⌘T then opens a tab in
# it. ⌃1–⌃9, ⌥⌘← and ⌥⌘→, with the page or the UI focused, and clicks on the switcher's dots show
# another Space, which shows the tab it showed last. Two fingers across the sidebar page to the
# Space a flick or the pages' place points at, never past the last, fingers along it don't, and a
# wheel's tick across pages once. A right-click on a row as a Space's rows slide in shows its
# tab's menu. A tab's menu moves the tab to another Space, which the window shows with it, and
# into another Space's folder, listed under its Today, which ⌘Z undoes. Return
# with no name does nothing, New Space from the footer's + shows a form
# already open, and Cancel, or two fingers back, deletes its Space and goes back to the Space it
# was made from; fingers going on rubber-band the form. A right-click on the Space's name, a
# dot or its card in the Library shows Rename Space, Change Icon…, Edit Theme Color… and Delete
# Space, and Remove Theme Color once the Space has a colour, and one on the sidebar's empty space
# shows New Tab and New Folder… before them; an emoji committed after Change Icon…
# is the Space's icon, in its dot's place, until Remove Icon. Rename, the Spaces
# menu's too, and a double-click on the name, turn it into a field, where a right-click shows the
# field's menu, return keeps the name and escape cancels. A Library card's field lights with the
# pointer on its brush or icon slot too. The brush opens the theme picker beside itself, which
# makes the Space light and dark, and the slot hangs the icon picker from itself, the Library
# staying open under them; another card's slot moves the picker there, and escape closes the
# picker, then the Library. A click on the card's name makes it a field in the card, the Library
# staying open. Delete asks first for a Space with tabs,
# in a dialog that a click around cancels and return confirms, and the Space goes once the dialog
# has, which a toast says. ⌘Z brings it back where it was, with its name and tabs. Its tabs close
# with it and reopen with ⇧⌘T in the Space shown, which ⌘Z then leaves out, and the last Space
# can't be deleted. The Spaces menu lists the Spaces, and its names show them. A page out of sight,
# behind another tab, in a Space not shown, in a minimized window or a hidden app, is hidden and
# runs no animation frames, and it's visible once it's back.
# A Space made from the first of two goes right after it, as Arc's does.

# Spaces. A new one is empty, and each keeps its tabs and the one it showed last. The page puts
# "hidden" in its title as it hides, and "visible <n>" as it shows again, with the n animation
# frames it ran while hidden, where Chrome runs none, and "in <ms>" from the first to the last.
