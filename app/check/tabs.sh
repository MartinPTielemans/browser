# A tab opened from the command bar goes at the top of the Space's Today tabs and shows. The command
# bar lists the Space's other tabs before anything is typed, those shown last first, and suggests
# pages from history as it's typed in, growing to fit them, with the tabs already at them, never the
# one shown, and well-known sites under them. An open tab whose name the typing starts is the first
# row. ↩ or a click on a tab's row shows that tab without opening one. Typing at the end completes
# the text to the first row's page, and ↩ goes there. ⌘L opens the bar centred and a click on the
# URL field over the field. ⇧⌘A opens it for Search Tabs, listing the open tabs alone, which typing
# filters, and ↩ switches to the one left. ⌘T or ⌘L closes the open bar again, ⌘L's field holds the
# whole address, and ↩ on it as it opened reloads the page. Tab in the empty field, or "/ ", lists
# only the commands, which typing filters, until Esc or ⌫ at the start leaves. ⌘1–⌘9, ⌥⌘↓, ⌥⌘↑ and
# clicks on rows show tabs. ⌃Tab, with the page or the UI focused, shows the tab shown before, and
# with ⌃ held goes on back through the tabs in the order they were shown, and ⌃⇧Tab the other way,
# until ⌃ goes up or a click. A tab a page opens goes under it and closing it goes back there, and
# ⌘W otherwise shows the tab below, or above at the bottom. Tabs opened behind close to their
# sibling, then their opener; after a switch to an unrelated tab, a tab opened in front closes to
# the tab below; and a pinned tab's newest tab opened in front closes back to it, past an older one.
# Closing the last tab leaves the Space empty, where ⌘T still works. Mute/Unmute Tab mutes a tab,
# its row shows a speaker while it plays, crossed out while it's muted, and a click on it unmutes
# the tab. There ⇧⌦ takes a page out of history, as a click on the ✕ the pointer draws on its row
# does, and ⌥⌘⌫ a search typed before, ⇧⌘↩ searches for what was typed, ⌘↩ opens it in a tab behind
# that loads once it's first shown, Tab on the row that hints a search engine, or a space after its
# keyword, searches with that engine alone until ⌫ leaves, ↩ on a sum's row copies its result, and a
# right-click in its field shows the field's menu, with Paste and Go. Site Search Settings opens
# Chromium's search engines page. The command bar's tests, in src/command_bar/tests.rs, have the
# rest of its keys and what the menu's items do. A tab's menu walks by its keys past lines and
# dimmed items, selects by typing, opens a submenu by → and by the pointer, which crosses a row on
# its way there without taking it, picks what a press-drag-release ends on and closes on a click
# outside. A tab unseen for 2 hours lets go of its page as another is shown, unless it plays sound,
# its page asks before it's left or a split shows it, and loads it back with its history once shown,
# and Settings' Unload switch turns that off and on. Back right-clicked or held lists the pages
# back, nearest first, with their favicons, a row picked goes there, and ⌘-clicked it opens the page
# back in a tab behind. Tabs › Reset all tabs in this Space takes the loaded pinned tabs away from
# their pinned URLs back there, and leaves an unloaded one. ⌘-click and ⇧-click choose rows,
# whose menu and ⇧⌘C copy their links, one a line, and ⌘D, New Folder and ⌘W pin, folder and
# close them all, each one step for ⌘Z. Reports how long switches take.

# A Space's Today tabs. The page opens a tab of its own from its button, the way a link to a new tab
# does, p in it plays a quiet tone until x, and u has it ask before it's left, or stop asking. The
# app asks Chrome to trace its tab switches, timed as Chrome times its own: from the tab strip's
# change to the first frame shown. The trace is written as the app quits. In a handler attribute a
# bare open() is document.open(), which would blank the page instead.
