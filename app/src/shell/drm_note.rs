//! A note that a page needs protected-media playback Chromium doesn't have, such as Netflix's video:
//! a card under the URL field, where a page's question shows, until the tab goes to another site.
//! Safari's engine plays these sites with Apple's DRM, so its one button shows the tab's page there,
//! in the tab, and the profile keeps the site for it: its pages open there from then on, with no
//! note, until the Site Controls turn it off (decision 1). The site's session goes with the tab, so
//! the user stays signed in. Where the Mac has no engine to give, on macOS 13, and in an agent's
//! Space, whose tabs never switch, it opens the page in Safari instead and leaves the tab as it is.
//! Its ×, shown under the pointer, and escape while the UI has the keyboard close it for the site in
//! the profile, across launches, or for a private window's session: the core no longer reports it
//! there, and the Site Controls offer Safari's engine for the site instead, the way back to its
//! button. The site's own error stays in the page. Agents get no path: it hands the user's page to
//! another engine or app. The core reports it (tab_media_unsupported) and keeps the sites it was
//! closed for (tab_close_media_note).
//!
//! On Linux a Widevine page's note offers Google's Widevine module instead, named as Google's and
//! downloaded from Google only at the button's yes; Linux loads it at launch, so the note then
//! offers a restart, which brings the page back. Its × is the no, and Settings › Advanced keeps the
//! way back. In an agent's Space it says why and offers nothing, as the yes is the user's alone.
//!
//! On Windows, Chromium plays sites that offer Microsoft's PlayReady where the PC can, so the note
//! shows only where it can't, and says why: it needs Windows 11, an x64 PC and graphics with
//! hardware DRM, outside private windows (bc_playready_needs). It offers nothing, as there's no
//! other engine to give.
//!
//! In Safari's engine the note says why a protected video shows black when the display connection's
//! protection (HDCP) falls short, as a dock's can, which the site never says. A statement, with
//! nothing to offer: the fix is the user's cable. Its × and escape close it for the tab, until it
//! goes to another site, as the cause is the desk's and not the site's.
