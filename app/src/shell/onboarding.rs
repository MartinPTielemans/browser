//! A new profile's first launch (docs/ux-spec.md › Onboarding): ilo's intro, then one message a
//! screen, over the whole window on the brand's ground. Only a launch with nothing to bring back
//! starts it, and Help › Welcome to ilo plays it again, so a normal launch never draws or loads any
//! of it. Any key or click skips the intro; Esc or Skip goes on from a step, and the last step's
//! leaves the flow for the first Space's welcome. A page shown ends it, as the page would cover it.
//! A step's button does what it offers, such as asking the system to make ilo the default browser
//! or giving the first Space its colour; Skip doesn't. The flow ends with the command bar up over
//! the first Space, and a line on the card under it saying what the bar is.
