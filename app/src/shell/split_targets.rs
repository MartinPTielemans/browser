//! Add Split View's targets (Dia, docs/ux-spec.md › Split view › Drag targets): a tab dragged out
//! of the sidebar over the page becomes a picture of a window, and a target slides in at each of
//! the card's sides, and at its top and bottom as Arc's stacks them. Let go over one, the tab joins
//! the page shown in a split view on that side. A link dragged over the page brings the same
//! targets, and let go on one it opens in a pane there.
//! GPUI can't draw over the page's native view, so the app draws them in a window of its own over
//! the browser window, which the mouse goes through (`Browser::show_drop_targets`).
