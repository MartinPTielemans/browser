//! Updates on Linux, where ilo is the Flatpak on Flathub (docs/ux-spec.md › Updates): Flatpak's
//! portal says when Flathub has a newer build, ilo installs it beside the one running, without
//! waiting for the software centre, and offers to restart into it. Outside a Flatpak, as in a dev
//! build, there's no portal to ask, and no updates.
