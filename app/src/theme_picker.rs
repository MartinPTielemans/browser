//! at the row or Space it was opened from, with the appearance buttons over a square field where
//! the colours are placed, − and + for how many, a row of swatches, and a wave slider for the
//! intensity and a dial for the grain (docs/ux-spec.md › Themes). The window's colour follows
//! each move live. Like the icon picker, it's a window of its own that the host shows over the
//! browser window, as its child; what it asks of that window goes through `Host`.
