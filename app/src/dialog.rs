//! The dialog that asks before something hard to take back, such as deleting a Space with its
//! tabs, or before quitting: a card over the window, which dims, as Arc's (docs/ux-spec.md ›
//! Spaces › Renaming and deleting, and Warn before quitting). GPUI can't draw over the page's
//! native view, so it's a window of its own that the host shows over all of the browser window,
//! as its child, with the keyboard. What it asks of its window goes through `Host`. It also asks
//! Chrome's questions, such as whether to add an extension, which wait their turn behind the
//! dialog that shows and which Chrome can take back, the account's, such as whether to add a
//! device, which wait and go the same way, and a page's own, such as its alert(), over
//! its tab's card alone, which come and go with the tab (docs/ux-spec.md › Page dialogs).
