//! Import from the other browsers on the machine (#453): one view, shown in Settings › Import and
//! as a step of the first launch, that lists the browsers found, the one used last first, and
//! brings in what the user picks from one: Arc's Spaces with their names, icons, themes and
//! profiles, their pinned tabs and folders, its link rules and its favorites; the other browsers'
//! bookmarks, from Chromium's family, Firefox's and Safari, as a Space named after the browser,
//! with Safari's Reading List; and every one's history. Saved passwords and cookies never come from another
//! browser's files: passwords come from a file the user exports, behind that browser's own
//! sign-in, which Chrome's password importer reads (bc_profile_import_passwords), and the user
//! signs in again to the rest.
//!
//! It reads the user's data, so it's the user's alone: agents get no path to it, and nothing of a
//! passwords file, its rows or its counts. It only reads
//! the other browser's files, and it adds through the core's calls a user's actions make, so a
//! second run adds nothing the first did (plan.rs).
