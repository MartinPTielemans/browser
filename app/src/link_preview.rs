//! The link preview: a link clicked in a pinned tab or a favorite, to another site than the tab's,
//! opens over the window in a card rather than taking the tab away from its own site (Arc's Peek,
//! docs/ux-spec.md › Phase 4 features). The page is a real one, in a tab of no Space, in its
//! native view, which the host puts over this window's card. ⌘↩ or the card's button keeps it as a
//! Today tab, as it is. GPUI can't draw over the page's native view, so the dim and the card are a
//! window of their own that the host shows over the browser window, as its child, as the
//! dialog's are. Where no window of the app's can hold a page, as on Linux, the page shows in the
//! browser window under this one, which leaves it a hole and draws the card round it. What it asks
//! of its window and the core goes through `Host`.
