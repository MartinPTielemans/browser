//! The command bar. GPUI can't draw over the page's native view, so the bar is a window of its
//! own that the host shows over the browser window, as its child. Under its input it lists the
//! core's suggestions for what's typed, and the window grows down to fit them. While the first is
//! selected, the input completes what's typed to it, as Chrome's address bar does. Its size and
//! rows are Arc's (docs/ux-spec.md › Command bar). Tab on a row that hints a search engine, or a
//! space after the engine's keyword, searches only with that engine until ⌫ leaves, as Chrome's
//! keyword mode does. A click on the sidebar's URL field opens a narrower panel over the field,
//! as Arc's does. What it asks of the core and of its window goes through `Host`.
