//! Agents: Claude Code, Codex or any other MCP client works in the browser, each in a Space of its
//! own, through the browser's MCP server (decision 8). Settings › Agents turns the server on, which
//! it isn't at first, connects the clients and lists what each agent did. The server is a Unix
//! socket in the profile directory, or a named pipe on Windows, which a client reaches through the
//! bridge it launches. Its threads sleep in the kernel between messages, so an idle browser wakes
//! for none of it, and nothing here runs on tab switch, new tab or launch: the saved settings are
//! read after the first window shows.
//!
//! A client proves which agent it is with the token Connect wrote into its config, which its bridge
//! hands the server first. Each tool call reaches the UI thread as an event, and the tools answer
//! through the core, which checks each call on a tab with bc_agent_may_act. That check's answer is
//! the call's activity-log entry. A payment, an order, a message sent or a bank's site asks the
//! user first, in a card in each window: once, always or never on that site, for that agent.
//! Settings › Agents and the agent's Space's menu list what the user answered for good, to revoke.
