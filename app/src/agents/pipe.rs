//! The agents' server on Windows: a named pipe, owned by the user and open to them alone, as the
//! Unix socket elsewhere is a file only they can open (server.rs). No other user or service can
//! connect to it or make an instance of it, no other machine can reach it, and a client checks
//! the pipe it reached is the user's before it hands over its token, so a pipe another user made
//! first under the name gets nothing. Its handles are overlapped, as a synchronous pipe handle
//! lets one thread's write wait for another's read, and each wait also watches the connection's
//! closed event, so closing it ends what another thread waits in. Threads wait in the kernel
//! between messages, as on a socket, so an idle server wakes nothing.
