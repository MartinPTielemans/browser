//! The hover card: resting the pointer on a sidebar tab shows a card beside its row, with a picture
//! of the tab's page as it last looked, its title and host, and buttons that pin or unpin it, make
//! it a favorite and open it in a split view (#430; ours, from docs/ux-principles.md and the design
//! tokens). It crosses the sidebar's edge onto the page, which GPUI can't draw over, so as the
//! tooltip is, it's a window of its own that the host shows over the browser window, as its child,
//! and it never takes the keyboard. What it asks of its window goes through `Host`.
//!
//! The pictures are the core's (`bc_tab_picture`), taken after a tab is hidden, never on the switch
//! that hides it, at most twice the card's size, and held here in memory alone, by tab, until the
//! tab unloads or closes or the system is short of memory.
