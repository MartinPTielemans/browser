//! Google's Widevine module, which Netflix, Spotify and Disney+ play their video with in Chromium,
//! on Linux alone (#236). It's Google's proprietary file, which ilo never ships: the
//! protected-media note offers to download it from Google the first time a page needs it, and
//! Settings › Advanced shows it and removes it, or downloads it for a site whose note was closed.
//! Linux loads it at launch, so a page plays with it once the browser restarts, which brings the
//! page back. Elsewhere the core offers none, and neither do the note and Settings. Agents get no
//! path to the yes: the core takes it from the user's click alone.
