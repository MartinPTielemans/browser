//! and Windows, whose system faces differ by machine and mostly run wider than SF, so text that
//! fits on the Mac would clip there. The site's demo draws as they do. Inter (OFL, its license in
//! `assets/fonts`) is built in only there: release 4.1's static instances at the four weights the
//! chrome sets, subset to Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and the symbols the chrome draws (NOTICE). Other
//! scripts, such as Japanese, fall back to the system's faces.
