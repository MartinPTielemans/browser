//! A Space's theme, as Arc's theme picker makes it: one to three colours placed in a square field,
//! how strongly the window takes them, its grain and the texture it lies in, and its appearance
//! (docs/ux-spec.md › Themes). A theme from Arc can also have another look for a dark window, and
//! its third colour exactly. The core keeps it with the Space as text, and the main colour as the
//! Space's colour.
//!
//! The field is a disc of HSL colours about its centre (Arc 1.170 rec at 2×, twelve handles): the
//! hue is the angle clockwise from the right, saturation is 1, and lightness is the distance from
//! the centre in half the field's width, black at the centre and white at the edge. A second colour
//! is the main one's complement; with a third the two sit 150° and 210° round from it, until one
//! is dragged to a place of its own. Dragging the main one moves them all with it. A swatch places
//! the main colour at its hue and lightness and keeps its saturation, the others' too, until a
//! handle is dragged.
