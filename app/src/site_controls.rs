//! The Site Controls: the panel the URL field's Site Controls button opens, as Arc's Site
//! Control Center (docs/ux-spec.md › Extensions › Site Controls). For the site of the page shown:
//! the action tiles, the turned-on extensions, whether ads and trackers are blocked there, its
//! saved logins, its permissions as Chrome's page info lists them, each changeable, and its
//! connection. GPUI can't draw over the page's native view, so it's a window of its own that the

//! over a blur in its shape with a shadow. What it asks of its window and the core goes through
