//! What the chrome draws with over a Space's theme, or with none (#320's rules): the window's
//! tint and how strongly the theme lies over it, the text and glyphs' alphas, the Space's accent
//! and the label on it, and the opaque fills of what floats over the page.
//!
//! The window is translucent, Dia's measured composite (check/window.sh), so what's behind it
//! shows through, and a theme is the user's, anything the picker makes. So what's drawn over it
//! is chosen against the window's every point over a black and a white backdrop, the extremes:
//! the ink's alphas are floored where they'd fade, a theme the ink can't read on takes the least
//! shade of the tint's colour that lets it read, and the accent is the main colour moved in OKLab
//! lightness, its hue kept, until it reads everywhere it's drawn. A dark window draws Paper over
//! its material under black, a light one Ink under white. It's worked out once when a
//! Space's theme changes, never while drawing. The tests sweep the picker's output and hold every
//! component to WCAG's minimums.
