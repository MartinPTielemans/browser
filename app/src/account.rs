//! Settings › Sync: the browser's account on an ilo server, which syncs the Spaces, and the
//! first profile's bookmarks, passwords and open tabs, across the user's devices (the core's
//! bc_sync_ calls). Signed out, it offers to sign in, and the server to sign in to. Once signed in,
//! the account's first device shows the recovery words once. A new device waits for another to add
//! it, with the code both show, or takes the words. Signed in, it lists the devices. The core signs
//! in, keeps the keys and syncs; this view says where the account is and asks. Each state has its
//! way out: Cancel while it waits, Sign Out, Remove, and Not me on the other device. Agents get
//! none of it.
