//! The link preview of platform/host.h on Linux. Its window, the dim and the card, is an overlay
//! over the browser window (overlays.rs). No window of the app's can hold a page here, so the page
//! shows in the browser window, over its own pages (the core's ShowPageIn), and the overlay has a
//! hole there, where it draws its card round it. The page has the window's keyboard, as a tab's
//! would, and the core hands the preview the keys it acts on, as on the Mac.
//!
//! shortcut: the page doesn't scale with the card's motion, as the Mac's does. It's laid out where
//! it rests, and shows where the frame the card draws meets that. The preview also stays when the
//! user goes to another window, where the Mac's closes.
