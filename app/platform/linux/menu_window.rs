//! ilo's own context menu's window (src/menu.rs) on Linux, as mac/menu_window.mm is on the Mac:
//! GPUI's Linux platform shows it over the window it opened for as one of its overlays
//! (overlays.rs), with the keyboard, and the menu's own window takes its pointer events. A press
//! outside, the keyboard going elsewhere or the window resizing is the user leaving it.
//!
//! A right-click elsewhere in the UI opens that menu in its place, as the press reaches the UI
//! before GPUI tells the menu it was left, and a leaving is told only to the showing it left.
//!
//! shortcut: the pointer isn't the menu's first, so a press outside closes it and lands where it
//! was pressed too. It stays inside its window, which it can't go past under Wayland.
//!
//! From the Linux driver's branch (feat/linux-drive, a566b45), which shows it the same way.
