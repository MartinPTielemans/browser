//! The Site Controls and Capture of platform/host.h on Linux, which float over a browser window
//! with its keyboard until the user leaves them, as their windows do on the Mac. GPUI shows each as
//! an overlay of that window (overlays.rs); the core lends it the window's keyboard while it has it.
//!
//! The Site Controls cast their shadow from a window under them (shadows.rs), which scales and
//! fades with the frames they draw of their motion.
//!
//! The pointer over Capture is the crosshair while it would be the camera on the Mac.
//!
//! shortcut: no blur under the Site Controls, and no camera: a crosshair is a cursor both X11's
//! cursor themes and Wayland's cursor shapes name, as a picture would need one of each.
