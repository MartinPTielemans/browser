//! The overlays of platform/host.h on Linux: GPUI's Linux platform shows each over the browser
//! window: a subsurface of it under Wayland, and on X11 a window of its own over it, as the X
//! server blends no child window's edges and a compositor blends a window's. The core lends it the
//! window's keyboard while it shows.
//!
//! Each casts its shadow from a window under it (shadows.rs). The icon and theme pickers grow in
//! from their arrows, and the theme picker shrinks back to it, as on the Mac, drawn by GPUI
//! (motion.rs).
//!
//! shortcut: no blur under them.
