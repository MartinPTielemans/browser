//! Test driver for check.sh on Linux, as platform/mac/drive.mm is on the Mac. With BROWSER_DRIVE=1
//! the app reads one command per line on stdin, in drive.mm's language, and sends the matching X
//! events to its own windows only: Chromium's browser windows, and GPUI's UI and overlays in and
//! over them. Each window's own client handles them as it would the device's: Chromium takes core
//! events, and GPUI takes a sent core pointer event for the XInput 2 one it selects. So they go
//! through the same hit testing, focus changes and shortcuts as real input, without touching the
//! display's pointer or keyboard. Keys go to the window with the X server's input focus, as real
//! keys do, and the pointer's events to the window of the app's on top at that point.
//!
//! Under Wayland no client can hand another's surfaces input, so there the pointer and keys are
//! sway's virtual devices, in tools/headless.sh's session alone (drive_wayland.rs).
//!
//! The commands are drive.mm's, with what Linux has: click, doubleclick, rightclick, middleclick,
//! clickkey, doubleclickkey, rightclickkey, drag, dragkey, press, dragto, release, rightpress,
//! rightdragto, rightrelease, dragover, dragdrop, dragleave, move, scroll, wheel, pageswipe, key,
//! keydown, keyup, flags, type, resize, place, order, layout, state, title, pasteboard, front, menu,
//! menubar, choose, dismiss, window, agentspace, agentmayact,
//! agentrelease, agentdisconnect, takeback, age and insert. The Mac's modifiers are pressed as the app reads them off the Mac (keys.rs):
//! cmd with Ctrl, ctrl and alt with Alt, and ⌃Tab as Ctrl+Tab; a click's as Chrome reads
//! them, cmd with Ctrl and alt with Alt. flags presses and lets
//! go of those keys, the last key's among them, and the keys after it go with what it holds. insert
//! commits its text to a field of the UI's, not a page's. scroll turns the wheel a notch for each event,
//! where the Mac's moves the content by points. choose works on ilo's menu and on ilo's dialog,
//! whose buttons it presses by their labels as drive.mm does an alert's, and dismiss on the menu;
//! Linux shows no alerts yet. fullscreen toggles the window's full screen through the core. ime on types as
//! drive.mm's scripted input method does, in the UI's fields alone, as a page's input method is
//! Chromium's, and it can't compose in a page. dragover and dragdrop are XDND's source, as
//! another app's drag is, to the browser window's top-level window or its proxy, and wait for its
//! answer. The others, such as swipe and displays, the driver can't do yet, and says so as drive.mm
//! does. pip, which drive.mm doesn't have yet, finds a video's Picture in Picture window, the Mini
//! Player, and logs "browser: pip at <x> <y> <width> <height>" as it is and each time it moves or
//! resizes, then "browser: pip gone", or "browser: pip none" without one. pip doubleclick, pip
//! wheel, and pip press, dragto and release work in it, at points from its top-left corner as the
//! command finds it, or as it was at the press. pip press, dragto and release alone move the
//! display's pointer, through XTest, onto the Mini Player only, and the release puts it back.
//!
//! It logs as drive.mm does: "browser: drive <n>: <command>" as command n arrives, "browser: drive
//! <n>: can't do that" for one it can't, and "browser: drive <n> done, key <window>, focus <view>,
//! active <0|1>, marked <none|start,length>" once Chromium and GPUI have handled its events, with
//! what the UI's field with the keys has marked. The window and view
//! are named as AppKit's classes are on the Mac, so the runs read one vocabulary: key is
//! BrowserCoreNSWindow for a browser window, GPUIPanel for an overlay and NativeWidgetMacNSWindow for
//! a window of Chromium's, such as an extension's popup or a tab's dialog, and focus
//! RenderWidgetHostViewCocoa for a page, AccessKitSubclassOfGPUIView for the UI and GPUIView for an
//! overlay's. Active is whether the input focus is in one of the app's windows.
