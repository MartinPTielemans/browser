//! A held Escape's repeats reach only the window its press went to, as on the Mac (host.mm's
//! WatchHeldEscape). The command bar and the find bar close on Escape going down, which gives the
//! browser window back the keyboard, and the X server's repeats of the held key would go on to the
//! page there, taking it out of its own full screen or closing its dialog.
//!
//! An Escape press GPUI gets marks the key held, until this connection of the host's own hears it
//! let go in the browser windows or the window the press went to. Until then the page's Escape
//! presses are the held key's repeats, and the app keeps them. X11 only: a Wayland compositor
//! sends no repeats, and each client makes its own from the keys it got.
