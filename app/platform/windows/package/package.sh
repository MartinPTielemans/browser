# Packs the Windows app for a release (#454), in Git Bash on Windows, from Browser.dll, which
# `cargo build --release --features prod` in app/windows makes, the agents' bridge, which
# `cargo build --release --features prod --manifest-path ../Cargo.toml --bin mcp-bridge
# --target-dir target` there makes, and the engine setup.sh puts in .deps/engine, whose chrome.exe
# runs it:
#   <out>/ilo-<version>-x64.msix, for the Microsoft Store, unsigned, as the Store signs it, with
#     the identity in branding/windows-store.ini and without WinSparkle, as the Store updates it;
#   <out>/ilo-<version>-x64-setup.exe, the per-user installer (ilo.iss) for winget and direct
#     downloads, unsigned for 0.1.0, with WinSparkle beside Browser.dll when setup.sh fetched it.
# Without an engine it packs Browser.dll alone, and with the identity's placeholders a test MSIX,
# each named for it, to try the packaging: neither installs a browser that runs. --release stops on
# either instead. The version is Cargo.toml's, with the 0 the Store wants last in the MSIX's.
