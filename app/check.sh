# Runs the app and checks what it does.
# Each run's file in check/ says what it checks. ./check.sh tabs spaces does only those runs, in
# that order, and ./check.sh all of them:
#   load keys tabs window popup history spaces agents profiles restore relaunch find pinned clear
#   split favorites cards extensions adblock adblock-lists windows private capture media
#   passwords links preview access trouble dialogs crash import quit onboarding passkeys mcp
#   appearance about sync sync-account
# The store run installs from Google's Web Store, adblock-live blocks Google's ad servers with
# uBlock Origin's own lists and widevine, Linux's alone, downloads Google's Widevine module, so they
# need the network and run only when named: ./check.sh store.
# Updates runs only when named too, until it passes on the Mac. So does keychain, which uses the
# real Keychain, on the prod build and only in a check VM. Shots takes the Store's pictures from
# pages on the internet, so it runs only when named too.
# Every run but load and crash needs Browser to be the active app, and window, find and updates
# take it full screen for a moment. Passkeys is the Mac's alone so far. Updates makes
# build/Updates.app on the Mac, a copy with Sparkle and a feed of its own (build.sh updates), and
# ilo's Flatpak on Linux, which a repository of the run's own updates (check/updates.sh).
# In a check VM the check turns the Mac's appearance dark for the runs, which read the window's
# dark look, and puts back the one it had after.
# It opens on the Mac's own screen, where there is one, so it doesn't cover what's playing on
# another; BROWSER_DISPLAY=main opens it on the main display.
# Leaves window captures and logs in build/check/. Build first with ./build.sh.
# BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR gives the app and the runs another profile directory, such as a new one for
# each run, since one an earlier run left can lack what a run expects, such as its search engines.
# On Windows it runs under Git Bash, with python3 on the PATH, on the app the engine's chrome.exe
# runs from build/Browser. The runs need what the Windows driver (platform/windows/drive.cc) does
# so far: load, tabs, dialogs, crash, about and onboarding.
# On Linux it runs itself in a headless sway session of its own (tools/headless.sh --run), on its
# Xwayland, and the app's windows and input then never reach the owner's session. Of the runs,
# load and history pass there so far; the others stop where they need what Linux hasn't yet, such
# as Japanese input in a page (keys), ilo's menu over the command bar (tabs) and IME (spaces),
# which the driver says it can't do. Captures are the session's whole output.
# BROWSER_XVFB=1 runs it under Xvfb and openbox instead, which CI has. BROWSER_WAYLAND=1 runs it
# on the sway session's Wayland, where the driver's input is sway's virtual pointer and keyboard
# (platform/linux/drive_wayland.rs), which it refuses outside that session.
